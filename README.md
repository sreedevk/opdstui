# TUI OPDS Browser
## Introduction
I wanted a way to browse my E-Book library hosted on self-hosted instance of [kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com/) via a TUI interface and
read the books using [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/), thus eliminating the need to download books from kavita web interface before being able to read them
using zathura. I couldn't find a tool that offered a TUI interface to browser OPDS catalogs, so i decided to write one myself.

This project does not aim to implement the whole [OPDS specification](https://opds.io/).

## Sources
This project is hosted on
- [Github](https://github.com/sreedevk/opdstui) - [sreedevk/opdstui](https://github.com/sreedevk/opdstui)
- [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) - `rad:z4QBXcbUuZuJKkN57ysdWbr5iGGZK`

## Pre Requisites
#### Runtime Dependencies
1. [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/)
2. [An OPDS Source](https://opds.io/)

#### Build Dependencies
1. [Nim Compiler](https://nim-lang.org/)
2. [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## Caveats
I consider this tool feature complete for my own use and any development would just be small improvements to the tool.
But if things don't work as expected for you, feel free to open an issue, I'll try and fix / improve things.
Please refer to the [TODO](#todo) section on this page to make sure you're not reporting already known issues.
As always, pull requests are welcome, but please open an issue before you start working.

## Installation
### Build From Source
```bash
# clone the repository from radicle
rad clone rad:z4QBXcbUuZuJKkN57ysdWbr5iGGZK

# or clone the repository from github
git clone https://github.com/sreedev/opdstui

# cd into opdstui directory
cd opdstui

# run make to ensure that you're able to build the tool first
make 

# copy the binary to /usr/local/bin
sudo make install
```
