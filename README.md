# TUI OPDS Browser
## Introduction
I wanted a way to browser my E-Book library hosted on [kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com/) via a TUI interface and
read the books using [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/), thus eliminating the need to interact with the kavita web interface. 
I was unable to find a tool that quite did this, so I decided to write one myself.

## Pre Requisites
1. [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/)

## Caveats
I consider this tool feature complete for my own use and any development would just be small improvements to the tool.
But if things don't work as expected for you, feel free to open an issue, I'll try and fix / improve things.
Please refer to the [TODO](#todo) section on this page to make sure you're not reporting already known issues.
As always, pull requests are welcome, but please open an issue before you start working.

## Installation
```bash
# run make to ensure that you're able to build the tool first
make 

# copy the binary to /usr/local/bin
sudo make install
```
